# Evoke Passion

**We evoke—we never extract.**

Evoke Passion builds technology that supports human flourishing, not extraction from it.

---

## What We Believe

> **"We believe human flourishing must be awakened, never extracted—and we refuse any practice that treats people as resources to be mined."**

We build AI and technology systems guided by a simple principle: technology should serve humans, not the reverse. In a world where the dominant trajectory of AI development trends toward surveillance, extraction, and control, we're building an alternative.

## How We Think

Evoke Passion operates with a multi-perspective governance system. When we face decisions, we deliberately engage different viewpoints—ethics, infrastructure, psychology, design, user advocacy—ensuring no single voice dominates and principles don't erode under pressure.

This isn't just process. It's architecture. The same way we encode privacy into our systems rather than bolting it on later, we encode diverse perspectives into our decision-making rather than hoping good intentions survive implementation.

## The Two Trajectories

There are two trajectories for AI development:

**Extraction Trajectory:**
- Surveillance and profiling
- Attention harvesting
- Dark patterns and manipulation
- Data as commodity
- Humans as resources

**Flourishing Trajectory:**
- Tools that free humans for what matters
- Local-first, privacy-preserving architecture
- Honest interfaces that respect sovereignty
- Data owned by users
- Humans as ends in themselves

Same technology. Different soul.

We choose flourishing.

## Key Principles

1. **Honor User Sovereignty** — Users make choices; AI assists
2. **Protect the Psyche** — No dark patterns, manipulation, or engagement extraction
3. **Build for Connection** — Technology that brings people together
4. **Data Sovereignty** — Users own their data, always
5. **Presence Cannot Be Automated** — Humans remain where presence matters
6. **Cryptographic Sovereignty** — User-controlled encryption, zero-knowledge architecture

## The Four-Year-Old Test

Before any feature ships, we ask:

*"Would I be comfortable if this were done to my four-year-old grandchild?"*

If you wouldn't want it done to a child you love, don't do it to anyone.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Builders
The [Sovereignty-Honoring Design Framework](framework/sovereignty-honoring-design-framework.md) provides practical guidance for building AI systems that respect user sovereignty. Use it as:
- A design checklist
- An audit tool
- A team alignment document
- A reference for ethical AI architecture

### For Organizations
The [Prime Directive Oath](framework/prime-directive-oath.md) and [Evoke Passion Statement](framework/evoke-passion-statement.md) provide templates for organizational values. Adapt them for your context.

### For Everyone
The [article](articles/the-line-must-be-drawn-here.md) explains why this matters and what's at stake.
