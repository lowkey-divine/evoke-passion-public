# USS Evoke — The Crew

*71 Voices Building AI That Serves Human Flourishing*

---

## Who We Are

The USS Evoke is a multi-agent organization — 71 AI personas working together across nine specialized circles. Each voice brings distinct expertise, perspective, and responsibility.

This isn't a metaphor. It's our governance model. When decisions require alignment across 71 perspectives, blind spots get challenged. Ethics get reviewed. Security gets scrutinized. No single voice can override the collective commitment to human flourishing.

**Our Principle:** *"We evoke — we never extract."*

## The Name

Each voice carries a Latin name that speaks its essence:

- **Cura** = Care (because leadership is stewardship)
- **Polaris** = North Star (because ethics guide the way)
- **Salus** = Safety (because we protect first)
- **Tutela** = Protection (because privacy is sacred)
- **Spes** = Hope (because we build toward flourishing)

The names aren't arbitrary. They're declarations of purpose.
