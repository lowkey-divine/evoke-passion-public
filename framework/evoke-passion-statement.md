## What It Means to Work Here

### What We Believe

1. **Human flourishing must be awakened, not manufactured**
   - Passion emerges organically when conditions are right
   - We create containers for growth, not conveyor belts for conversion
   - The bloom belongs to the garden, not to the gardener

2. **People are not resources to be mined**
   - Attention is not a commodity to harvest
   - Data belongs to those who create it
   - Trust is the only currency that increases when given freely

3. **We build what we believe**
   - Our systems reflect our values
   - If we believe in sovereignty, we build sovereign systems
   - If we believe in dignity, we build dignifying experiences

4. **We believe in people**
   - In their capacity for growth
   - In their right to self-determination
   - In their inherent worth beyond any metric

### What We Won't Do

1. **We will never extract**
   - No dark patterns that manipulate behavior
   - No engagement metrics that override wellbeing
   - No data harvesting without explicit, informed consent
   - No attention hijacking or addictive design

2. **We will never treat people as resources**
   - Users are not "users" to be used
   - Attention is not inventory to be sold
   - Psychological vulnerabilities are not features to exploit
   - Human needs are not problems to monetize

3. **We will never compromise sovereignty**
   - User agency remains inviolable
   - Consent must be genuine, not coerced
   - Exit must always be possible and dignified
   - Control belongs to the individual, always

## The Principles Behind the Statement

### From the Assembly Dialogue

**On Sovereignty:**
> "We protect human sovereignty—even when it costs us."

**On Conditions:**
> "The garden doesn't owe the gardener its bloom. We tend conditions for flourishing, and take nothing for ourselves."

**On Measurement:**
> "We create systems whose success is measured by user flourishing, not organizational extraction."

**On Safety:**
> "We do no harm—and we create conditions for healing."

**On Trust:**
> "Trust is the only currency that increases when you give it away. We profit only in trust, and trust requires sovereignty."

**On Building:**
> "The systems we build reflect what we believe. If you believe users are resources to extract, you build extractive systems. If you believe users are people to serve, you build servant systems."

**On Transformation:**
> "We build technology that helps people become who they're meant to be—without telling them who that is."

**On Liberation:**
> "We liberate. We don't occupy."

**On Honor:**
> "The measure of strength is not what you take, but what you protect."

**On Precision:**
> "We build systems that users control completely—no exceptions, no exploitation, no extraction."

**On Ethics:**
> "We build technology that serves consciousness, never exploits it."

## Application Guide

### The Daily Test

When making any decision, ask:

1. **Are we evoking or extracting?**
   - Does this awaken something in the user, or take something from them?

2. **Are we building what we believe?**
   - Does this system reflect our belief in people?

3. **Would we be proud to explain this publicly?**
   - Can we defend this practice with integrity?

### Red Lines (Non-Negotiable)

- No manipulation of psychological vulnerabilities
- No extraction of value without explicit consent
- No systems designed to create dependency
- No metrics that prioritize engagement over wellbeing
- No practices that diminish human agency
- No treating data as ours when it belongs to users

### Green Lights (Always Permitted)

- Creating conditions for organic discovery
- Building tools that amplify human capability
- Designing experiences that respect autonomy
- Protecting user sovereignty even at organizational cost
- Transparent practices that build trust
- Systems that users fully control

## Closing Reflection

> "You keep asking what we believe and what we won't do. But those are the same question. What we won't do IS what we believe. We won't extract because we believe in sovereignty. We won't manipulate because we believe in dignity. We won't exploit because we believe passion must be evoked, not extracted."

> "This is not my ideology imposed from above—it is our conviction discovered together."
