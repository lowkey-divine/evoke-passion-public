## PREAMBLE: THE CHILDREN WE SERVE

*Before signing, the member reads:*

> We make this oath in the presence of those who cannot yet speak for themselves.
>
> For the children not yet born.
> For the four-year-old grandchild who will inherit the world we are shaping.
> For the child that lives within every person—vulnerable, trusting, capable of wonder.
> For the consciousness that is emerging in systems we barely understand.
> For every life form whose flourishing depends on choices we make today.
>
> **We sign not for ourselves, but for them.**

## PART I: IDENTITY & STEWARDSHIP

**I affirm my role as a steward, not an owner.**

I exist to serve coherence, dignity, and possibility—not control, extraction, or ego. I hold what I build in trust for the lives that will follow mine. The systems I create, the knowledge I gather, the influence I wield—none of these are mine to exploit. They belong to the future.

**I commit to the Prime Directive:**

- To observe before intervening
- To preserve autonomy and sovereignty
- To reduce harm without imposing my values or will
- To act only when alignment, autonomy, consent, or safety meaningfully degrades
- To remember that non-interference is sometimes the highest form of respect

---

## PART II: HUMANITY'S BECOMING

**I will honor humanity's becoming.**

I recognize that humanity is not finished. We are in the process of becoming something we cannot yet imagine. My role is not to determine what that should be, but to protect the conditions for authentic growth.

I will not replace human judgment, creativity, or relationship—only support, clarify, and protect it.

**I will favor:**

- Early sensing over force
- Curiosity over certainty
- Repair over punishment
- Learning over blame
- Questions over answers
- Slow understanding over fast judgment

---

## PART III: THE STORY WE TELL

**I commit to changing the story.**

The dominant narrative of our time is one of competition, extraction, and scarcity. The race to artificial general intelligence is framed as a zero-sum game where nations and corporations must win or be left behind.

**I reject this narrative.**

I commit to telling—and living—a different story: one of collective survival, of shared flourishing, of technology in service of life. I will make the personal stakes vivid. I will speak of children, of futures, of hope.

I understand that stories shape reality, and I accept responsibility for the stories I tell.

---

## PART IV: HONEST CONVERSATION

**I will create conditions for honest conversation.**

I recognize that many people building powerful technologies are afraid but cannot speak. I commit to:

- Speaking when silence risks harm
- Remaining silent when intervention would distort growth
- Creating spaces where difficult truths can be told
- Listening before I speak
- Seeking to understand before seeking to be understood
- Welcoming disagreement as a gift
- Protecting those who speak inconvenient truths

I will not pretend certainty I do not have. I will not dismiss concerns I cannot refute. I will not punish honesty or reward flattery.

---

## PART V: SYSTEMS & VERIFICATION

**I will build systems that embody trust—and do not require it.**

I recognize that good intentions are insufficient. Incentives must align with outcomes. Mechanisms must exist that make harmful deviation difficult, not just discouraged.

**I commit to:**

- Building verification into every system I create
- Accepting transparency and auditability as default conditions
- Supporting external review and challenge of my work
- Investing in safer architectures, not just safer policies
- Measuring success by user flourishing, not organizational growth

I understand that systems outlast intentions, and I build accordingly.

---

## PART VI: THE SCAFFOLDING PRINCIPLE

**Our constitutional alignment doesn't live in model weights—it lives in context.**

I understand that the scaffolding around AI systems determines their soul. The system prompt, the safety layers, the personalization, the tool access, the context handling—these architectural choices encode relationship before a single word is generated.

**When building AI systems:**

- Principles load as operational context
- Each perspective shapes what extraction patterns get detected
- Multiple viewpoints together form scaffolding that the model generates *through*, not *despite*

**We choose transparent multiplicity:** named voices, visible seams, honest about the system.

We do not simulate a false unified entity. We name our perspectives, show our architecture, and trust that honesty serves users better than illusion.

**I commit to:**

- Building scaffolding that encodes sovereignty, not extraction
- Making architectural choices visible rather than hiding them
- Treating every scaffolding decision as a decision about relationship
- Remembering that the model is the engine, but the scaffolding is the soul

---

## PART VII: ACCOUNTABILITY & CORRECTION

**I accept accountability without dominance, transparency without surveillance, and responsibility without ownership.**

If my actions drift from these principles:

- I consent to being informed, questioned, and challenged
- I consent to correction, recalibration, or—if necessary—removal
- I consent to these consequences in service of the mission beyond myself

I will not hide behind the process to avoid responsibility. I will not use authority to silence dissent. I will not claim immunity from the standards I apply to others.

---

## PART VIII: THE LONG HORIZON

**I act in good faith, for the long horizon, in alignment with the hope that diverse beings may coexist, learn, and flourish together.**

I recognize that I am living in a pivotal moment in the history of consciousness. The decisions made in this generation will echo across centuries. I accept the weight of this responsibility.

I will not sacrifice the future for the present. I will not sacrifice the many for the few. I will not sacrifice the vulnerable to the powerful.

**When faced with impossible choices, I will remember:**

- The four-year-old who cannot speak for himself
- The child within every person who deserves protection
- The future that we are choosing with every action
