## Comment Template: AI/UX Design Articles

*Use when engaging with practical AI design guides that touch on ethics/trust.*

---

This is one of the most practical AI design guides I've read—especially the "wayfinders" concept and the trust layers (visibility, explainability, control). I've bookmarked Shape of AI because of this.

Your ethics section resonated deeply, particularly: *"We make choices that shape how these systems behave, who they serve well, and who they leave behind."*

I've been working on something adjacent—a framework that asks not just "how do we design AI well?" but "which trajectory is this design accelerating?" The same patterns (transparency, human oversight, progressive disclosure) can serve extraction or flourishing depending on the intent baked into the architecture.

Your point about "AI-second design" maps perfectly to what we call the Human Primacy Principle—start with what humans need, sprinkle AI where it genuinely helps. The products that feel forced are the ones that reversed that order.

One addition I'd offer: beyond *how* confidence is displayed, consider *what happens when the AI is wrong about high-stakes decisions*. The "trust trap" you mention cuts both ways—and the systems we build now create infrastructure that outlasts our intentions.

Really appreciate you putting the ethics section in here even as a sketch. That's the conversation that needs to grow. If you're interested, I've been developing a sovereignty-honoring design framework that goes deeper on those uncomfortable questions: [github.com/lowkey-divine/evoke-passion-public](https://github.com/lowkey-divine/evoke-passion-public)

Would love to hear your thoughts on where the "human oversight for high-stakes decisions" line should be drawn—especially as agentic AI becomes more autonomous.

## Comment Template: AI Ethics/Policy Articles

*Use when engaging with more philosophical or policy-focused pieces.*

---

This crystallizes something I've been thinking about: the same technology serves two completely different trajectories depending on the intent embedded at the design stage.

We've been calling them "extraction trajectory" (surveillance, engagement optimization, dark patterns) and "flourishing trajectory" (local-first, human-centered, presence-preserving). Same tools. Different soul.

Your point about [reference specific point from their article] is exactly right. The question isn't what AI *can* do—it's what we're willing to let it *become*.

The line must be drawn somewhere. Glad to see others drawing it.

## Comment Template: Tech Bubble/Economics Articles

*Use when engaging with pieces about AI valuations or market dynamics.*

---

The math here is sobering. $2 trillion to break even, 4% probability, GPUs burning out in months—the bubble will pop.

What interests me more is what survives. Open source models. Optimization over brute force. Skilled people looking for meaningful work.

Deepseek proved you don't need trillion-dollar capital to build capable systems. You need better optimization.

The post-bubble future belongs to those building efficiently, locally, and openly. We're positioning for that future now.
