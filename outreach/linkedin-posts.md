## Option A: Personal/Story (Recommended for Founder Voice)

---

I used to believe technology was neutral.

I was wrong.

The same AI that handles your customer service refund also handles drone targeting. The same optimization techniques that make apps "engaging" make surveillance more pervasive.

Three things changed how I think about what we're building:

**1. Klarna** replaced 700 agents with AI. Then brought humans back. "Trust and satisfaction aren't purely transactional," they discovered. "They're emotional."

**2. The math** — AI companies need $2 trillion to break even. The bubble will pop. What survives matters.

**3. Nvidia + Palantir** — "Accelerating everything Palantir does." Including systems that, in their CEO's words, "on occasion kill people."

These aren't separate stories. They're the same question:

**What are humans for?**

One trajectory says: resources to optimize and surveil.
The other says: ends in themselves, to be served and freed.

Same technology. Different soul.

Every technical decision is now a moral decision. Every line of code is a vote for the future we're building.

We wrote about what we're building instead — and why presence cannot be automated.

The line must be drawn here.

## Option B: Shorter/Punchier (Higher Engagement)

The same AI that processes your refund also processes drone targeting.

The same "engagement" techniques that keep you scrolling enable mass surveillance.

Same technology. Different soul.

We wrote about the two trajectories of AI — extraction vs. flourishing — and why every technical decision is now a moral decision.

Key insight: **Presence cannot be automated.** AI excels at routine. Humans remain essential for care.

Klarna learned this the hard way. Every company will.

The question isn't what AI can do.

It's what we're willing to let it become.
